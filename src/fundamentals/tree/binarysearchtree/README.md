# BinarySearchTree

The binary search tree search and put efficiency depending on the order of data input.


e.g.

data: 100 90 80 50 110

the tree will be this behaviour
```
          100
       90    110
    80
 50
``` 
data2: 90 80 50 100 110

the tree will be this behaviour

```
           90
       80     100
    50            110

```


The tree is not balanced and exist problems of efficiency about search and insert.
