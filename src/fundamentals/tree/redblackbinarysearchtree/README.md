#### About Rotate Node Rules

1. if right subnode is red and left subnode is black,then execute left rotate
2. if left subnode is red and its left subnode also is red, then execute right rotate
3. if left subnode and right subnode both are red, the execute color flip. (current node's color change to red,left subnode and right subnode's color change to black)
