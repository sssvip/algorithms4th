# Graph

### The Graph Process Pattern
The representation and implement of Graph was separated.We will create many implement
about each kind of graph process algorithm.

#### Graph(Representation)
This implement edition was not include:
1. add a vertex
2. delete a vertex
3. delete a edge
4. check v-w edge whether exist

The reason that this edition did not implement the methods above:
1. Usage case sometimes needn't add and delete a vertex.
2. Simplify implement and more focus on Graph research process.
